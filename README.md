# Meta-GAIN
Extension of GAIN model for missing data imputation.

Some of the code is taken from Chelsea Finn's MAML implementation(https://github.com/cbfinn/maml), code from her CS330 Stanford class(https://cs330.stanford.edu/) and Jinsung Yoon's GAIN implementation(https://github.com/jsyoon0823/GAIN).
